Ingredients

For the Filling:

5oz golden caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp for sprinkling
1tsp ground cinnamon
2tbsp cornflour
600g cooking apple, peeled,cored and sliced

For the pastry

400g plain flour, plus some extra for rolling
2tbsp caster sugar
1 lemon for zest
250g cold butter, cut into cubes
2 free-range eggs, 1 beaten with 2tbsp cold water, 1 beaten to glaze


Instructions
1. For pastry, place the flour, sugar and lemon zest into one bowl and rub it into the butter until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the beaten egg and stir with a round-blade knife until the mixture forms a dough.
2. Set aside ⅓ of pastry for lid. Roll out the remaining pastry on a floured surface until the around 5-7cm thickness/2-3in larger than the pie dish. Lift the pastry over the rolling pin and lower it gently into the pie dish.
3. Press the pastry firmly into the dish and up the sides, making sure there aren't any air bubbles. Chill in the fridge for a few minutes.
4. Preheat the oven to 200℃/180℃(fan)/Gas 6. Place a baking tray into the oven to preheat.
5. For the filling, mix in sugar, cinnamon, and cornflour into a large bowl. Stir in the apples.
6. Place the apple filling into the pie dish, making sure that it rises above the edge. Brush the rim of the dish with the beaten egg.
7. Roll out the reserved ball of pastry. Cover the pie with the pastry and press the edges together firmly to seal. Using a sharp knife, trim off the excess pastry, then gently crimp all around the edge. Make a few small holes in the centre of the pie with the tip of a knife. Glaze the top with beaten egg.
8. Lightly knead the pastry trimmings and re-roll. Cut into the leaf shapes place all around the edge of the pie, slightly overlapping each others, and glaze with more egg. Sprinkle the pie with sugar and bake in the centre of the oven for 45-55 minutes or golden-brown all over and the apples are tender.
